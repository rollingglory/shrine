# Project Manager

### What do Project Managers do at RGB?

Project Manager is the center figure of the project which means you are not only expected to do administrative PM tasks e.g. creating timeline, progress report, etc. Instead, you are also responsible to directing the team to achieve the project goals, finding solution, and take care of the team not only as a project resource but ultimately as a person :\). 

In short, there are 2 main tasks:

1. **Keeps our backlog organized**.  Being organized means the backlog must be clearly defined, regularly updated, correctly prioritized, and delivered on time within the correct priority order. 
2. **Shield the team from unnecessary distractions** as possible so they can focus on their own task.

### Accountabilities

We believe in you, hence we got a few of expected abilities from you as follows.

|  | Accountability |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. | Able to comprehend, dig the requirement detail as needed, and define a clear scope of project to the team members. |
| 2. | Able to create a comprehensive timeline by breaking down the task, discuss with team members to provide man-days estimation for each task, analyze dependencies, and allocate buffers wisely. |
| 3. | Able to act as the filter between external/client and internal team. Thus, when giving an assignment to your team members, you have to be able to elaborate on why, how, and when the task should be done. |
| 4. | Always check the difficulty of the task to your team member. In this aspect, you better be able to put yourself in their shoes to practice empathy. |
| 5. | Make sure the task is well documented as stored in the project management system, given a clear deadline and assigned to the respective team member. |
| 6. | Able to set clear priority for each task based on business or technical impact |
| 7. | Able constantly tracking progress of each team member \(by project management tool and daily/weekly meeting\) to enforce smooth and on time delivery within the correct priority order |
| 8. | Able to escalate issues/enquiries to respective upper managers as necessary. |
| 9. | Able to maintain a smooth relationship with clients, external partners, and team members. |
| 10 | Ensure the deliverable has premium quality by efficiently managing the testing process done by QA and by yourself. |
| 11. | Able to create and maintain comprehensive project documentation and make sure itâ€™s updated as needed. |

          <li>Create comprehensive timeline in a Gantt Chart style and update it accordingly
            if necessary</li>
          <li>Before assembling a timeline, you have to:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Break down the task by yourself.</b> Then, you discuss with the internal
                team if the task breakdown is right or need to add or remove something.
                <br
                /><b>Note:<br />Why am I encouraging you to break the task down by yourself first?</b>
                <br
                />Because it will help you to understand faster about what should be done
                in the development e.g. the feature and the correlation with related detailed
                technical tasks. To do this, I recommend to discuss with the responsible
                tech lead, business analyst or any other relevant roles to make sure about
                your work.</li>
              <li>When the task list is done, proceed with <b>man-days estimation for each task</b>.
                If a team member isn&apos;t really confident with their estimation, ask
                them why, sometimes it&#x2019;s because they never develop anything like
                that. If it&#x2019;s the case, you can add a new task for research</li>
              <li>Lastly, arrange a timeline in a Gantt Chart style using task list and
                the estimated man-days.</li>
              <li>Don&#x2019;t forget to add allocation, testing and bug fixing. Moreover,
                it&#x2019;s recommended to also add a time buffer. Just in case there are
                some unexpected obstacles along the way, e.g. your developer gets sick
                or any other urgent reasons. Always ask the tech lead to make sure your
                buffer is just in a right amount.</li>
