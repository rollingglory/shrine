## Traffic

Traffic is the term we use for managing resources in development state. Here are the responsibilities

      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">To forecast resource allocation up to 1 or 2 months onwards (including

        <ul>
          <li>When a team or PM don&apos;t have any resources while the project status
            is urgent. On the contrary, resource of a project is urgently shifted to
            other project due to higher priority level.</li>
          <li>When there is a coaster/resource is not properly managed.</li>
          <li>Issues when a coaster is assigned to so many projects at the same time.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>

You can check the guideline below regarding how to do resource assignment for both Traffic/Development and Pandora.

## Pandora

Pandora is a term we use in managing project in pandora project. Pandora is a status when a project is still in a pitching state. So, it's not deal with RGB yet. But we still need to prepare the resources if the it finally deal. 

| Responsibility | Day to day activity | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Manage pandora execution process | Manage task ticketing via Proofhub \(BA, design, PgM\) |  |
| Resource allocation forecasting | Create a resource allocation planning for pandora if the pandora deal. |  |
